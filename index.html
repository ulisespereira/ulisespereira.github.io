<p>I am a forth year PhD student at the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago and a Fulbright fellow. My research interest is centered in understanding the mechanisms used by neural systems to represent and store information. I am currently working on two main projects:

1) Developing theoretical tools to analyze the relation between inputs temporal statistics and networks dynamics on networks with plastic synapses.

2)Developing neural models for associative memory with neurons with continuous firing rates. Matching these models with experimental data (i.e. in vivo recordings, connectomics data). Finding maximal capacity learning rules and compare them with learning rules inferred from neurophysiological experiments. Proving the attractor dynamics hypotheses in well known associative memory brain areas such as IT.
