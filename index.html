<p>

 I am fifth year  PhD student at the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. My dissertation is focused on unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal attractors in neural networks. In particular:
 <ul>

	 <li> We have shown that learning rules inferred from in vivo recording in monkeys inferior temporal cortex (ITC) generate attractor dynamics, without any need for parameter adjustment or tuning. Furthermore, these rules produce storage capacities close to the maximal capacity, in a broad family of learning rules.  Suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states.</li>
	 <li>
 Using mathematical techniques borrowed from spin glasses, We have shown that networks with learning rules inferred from ITC transition to a chaotic phase where an extensive number of fixed point attractors become chaotic attractors.  Thus, the network performs robustly as an associative memory device, even though strong fluctuations are internally generated by its own chaotic dynamics. Presenting irregular temporal dynamics similar to the temporal and across trial variability observed during delay periods in multiple studies. 
 </li>
 <li>
   We have developed theoretical tools for analyzing the relation between inputs temporal statistics and learning of fixed point attractors and sequential activity in networks with plastic synapses. Additionally, using mean field theory techniques we have derived analytical equations for the storage capacity of sequences of activity. 
   </li>
   </ul>
   Currently, I am working on developing tools for inferring online learning rules from neural recordings in ITC and building network models using these rules.
